        headPara: "Dienandt is a 17 year old producer from the Netherlands. His musical journey started at a very young age of 6 years old, getting piano lessons by his grandmother.",
        bodyPara: "At the start of his electronic music career, he was just learning how to use the still unfamiliar program, unconsciously developing a great passion for making music.",
        endPara: "Dienandt quickly got introduced to hard-hitting genres such as Bass Trap and Hard Trap, which he fell in love with. After more than a year of producing Bass Trap, Dienandt found his best-suited genre, Wave music. This much calmer type of music was a new experience for him, but after more than a year of hard work, he managed to create his own, unique sound in this genre.",
